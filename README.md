##Overview

To provide the user with an Expressive Graphing Calculator that takes in regular infix expression and spits out the simplified solution to the Expression.

##Concepts Demonstrated
Identify the OPL concepts demonstrated in your project. Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient. 
* **Data abstraction** is used to provide access to Simplify,KeyWordDefinitions,Derivative,Keypair.
* The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with **recursive data structures.**
* **Symbolic language processing techniques** are used in the parser.

##External Technology and Libraries
Briefly describe the existing technology you utilized, and how you used it. Provide a link to that technology(ies).

##Favorite Lines of Code
####Mark (a team member)
Each team member should identify a favorite line of code, expression, or procedure written by them, and explain what it does. Why is it your favorite? What OPL philosophy does it embody?
Remember code looks something like this:
```scheme
(map (lambda (x) (foldr compose functions)) data)
```
####Norman 
This procedure reads in a regular expression packages it into a string hands it over to a parser procedure that handles the expression and hands back the solution to an output-field which the user can see or have it plotted on the canvas depending on the expression.
```
;(init-value "Expression")
      (callback (Î» (input-field event)
            (cond
             ; If a user hits enter to compute an equation
            ((equal? (send event get-event-type) 'text-field-enter) 
             (begin
             ; Clear canvas
             (send pb erase)
             ; Set outputString to solved equation
             (set! outputString (main-parser (send input-field get-value)))
             ; Send outputString to output-field
            (send output-field set-value outputString))))))
```

####Lillian (another team member)
This expression reads in a regular expression and elegantly matches it against a pre-existing hashmap....
```scheme
(let* ((expr (convert-to-regexp (read-line my-in-port)))
             (matches (flatten
                       (hash-map *words*
                                 (lambda (key value)
                                   (if (regexp-match expr key) key '()))))))
  matches)
```

#How to Download and Run

1. Download the latest release from here: *release link* https://github.com/oplS15projects/Lambda
2. Open and run Lambda.rkt
3. Input expression is typed into the `Input`, using syntax: `keyword equation`
4. Output is seen in the `Ouput` or lower canvas depending on keywords used.

**Example 1:** `plot x+2*x+3` - support for only one variable **x** is currently available.

This will plot `x+2*x+3` in the lower canvas field

**Example 2:** `eval 1+2*3^4` or `1+2*3^4` will both evaluate to: 163. `eval` is the default keyword if no keyword is entered.

If `eval` is used on an equation with a variable, such as `x+2`, it will return `cannot evaluate: x+2` since there is a variable.
